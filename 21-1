Journal Entry:

Today was the first day of my MERN WinterPrep training, and it was both exciting and motivating. The session gave me a clear start into full-stack web development with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. I spent time understanding the basic concepts, setting up the environment, and familiarizing myself with the tools we will use in the upcoming weeks.

Apart from technical training, I also focused on planning my international career path as a fresher aiming for Europe/Switzerland. Here’s my detailed plan:
