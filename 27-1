Diary Entry:
Today, I took a bath and had breakfast in my room (217-B, Boys’ Studio). Later, I had tiffin—chapati and bonda—at the mess (Boys’ Studio-10). After that, I came to attend class.

I attended PEP 2026: MERN Stack, Session 1, which was scheduled from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. I am currently in class.
