2. Comparison of Approaches
Feature 	       Recursion	                        Iteration
Implementation	 Function calls itself	            Uses loop constructs
Memory	         High(uses call stack frames)	      Low (constant space if no extra data structures)
Speed	           Slower (overhead of method calls)	Faster (no call overhead)
Code Style	     Often shorter and more elegant	    Can be longer and more complex
Risk          	 Stack Overflow if too deep	        Infinite loops if condition never fails
